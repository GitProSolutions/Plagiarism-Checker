# Plagiarism Checker

## Project's Title

Plagiarism Checker is a Python program that compares two text files and calculates the similarity score between them. It uses the cosine similarity measure and TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) to determine the degree of similarity between the texts.

## Project Description

Plagiarism is a serious academic offense that can have serious consequences, such as expulsion from school or legal action. The Plagiarism Checker project is designed to help students and educators check for plagiarism in their written work. By comparing two texts, the program can detect similarities and determine if plagiarism has occurred.

The program preprocesses the texts by removing non-alphabetic characters and stop words, and stemming the words. Then, it calculates the cosine similarity score between the texts using the TF-IDF measure. If the similarity score is above a certain threshold (0.8 by default), the program considers the texts to be highly similar and reports a potential case of plagiarism.
